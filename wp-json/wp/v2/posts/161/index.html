Is it their first startup, their second or their third? Generally what I find is the more successful and the more wisdom you have, the more transparent you are over time, and possibly even cynical, right? But the first-time founders, they\u2019re under a lot of pressure [to do] whatever the VCs or hired people around them are telling them to do. They\u2019ve got to do it.
