It won an innovation award at CES 2019 for, as our writer put it at the time, \u201ca hands-free device that uses biomimicry and robotics to help women achieve a blended orgasm by simultaneously stimulating the G-spot and the clitoris.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But then the Consumer Technology Association, which runs CES, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/01\/08\/ces-revokes-award-from-female-founded-sex-tech-company\/\">withdrew the award and banned the company<\/a> from exhibiting at the show. Their explanation at the time was that neither the company nor its devices \u201cfit a product category.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Predictably, this attracted immediate blowback and allegations of sexism, prudery and generally bad judgment. Everyone was on Lora DiCarlo\u2019s side, and the publicity was invaluable, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/10\/03\/lora-dicarlo-founder-says-ces-award-snub-did-company-a-pretty-big-favor\/\">she later told TechCrunch at Disrupt<\/a>: \u201cI think they actually did us a pretty big favor.\u201d The company raised $2 million around that time, and about $9 million total over its five years of operation.<\/p>\n<p>But despite a big return to the show in 2020 (and a coveted <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/01\/10\/a-sex-tech-startups-triumphant-return-to-ces\/\">TC+ feature<\/a>, of course), the company seems to have faltered during the pandemic \u2014 perhaps falling victim to the same chip shortages and manufacturing problems even established hardware makers encountered.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/01\/10\/a-sex-tech-startups-triumphant-return-to-ces\/\">A sex tech startup\u2019s triumphant return to CES<\/a><\/p>\n\n<\/div>\n<p>As <a href=\"https:\/\/www.womens-health.com\/lora-dicarlo-offline\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">chronicled by Women\u2019s Health<\/a>, the last few months seem to have been Lora DiCarlo\u2019s last, as various aspects of a functioning commercial enterprise began to fail: orders weren\u2019t going out, stock was gone at retail partners and personnel have left. The site went down earlier this month and is down still. Although there has not been any official announcement, it certainly does seem that the company is kaput.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s too bad, but finding success as a hardware startup is hard enough without a pandemic and the stigma on sex toys adding drag.
